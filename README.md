An open-source radio mod for **Forza Horizon 6**. Adds a new in-game radio station fed from your **local music**, **online radio** stations, **Spotify**, **YouTube Music**, **Jellyfin** server, **Plex** server, or **any Windows app** (Deezer, a browser tab...), controlled from a browser dashboard.

## Features

- **Local files**: build named **stations** from one or more folders, exclude subfolders you don't want, and pick a play order (shuffle / albums / name / folder) with repeat modes and a searchable queue. MP3 / FLAC / WAV / OGG / M4A / AAC / OPUS / WMA / M3U / M3U8 etc.
- **Online radio**: search a directory of thousands of internet stations by name, genre, or country (via [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info)) or paste any stream URL; save favourites with logos and genre/bitrate badges, with live track info.
- **YouTube Music**: paste any video, playlist, or YT Music URL from the dashboard.
- **Spotify Connect**: cast from the Spotify app to an "FH6 Universal Radio" device (requires Spotify Premium).
- **Jellyfin**: stream playlists from your own Jellyfin server.
- **Plex**: scan and stream music playlists from your own Plex server, with Plex client playback timeline reporting.
- **External audio**: capture any Windows app (Deezer, a browser tab...) and pipe it into the radio through a virtual audio cable; metadata and next/previous come from the Windows media session.
- **In-game radio integration**: audio is routed through FH6's radio bus, fades with menus and reacts to in-game volume like every other station.
- **Live dashboard** at `http://localhost:8420`: switch source, transport controls, volume, settings.
- **Race start action**: on race begin, advance to next track, restart the current one, or leave it alone.
- **Quick station skip**: tune the radio knob away and back within 1s to skip the current track.
- **Loudness normalization**: For consistent volume across tracks.
- **5-band equalizer**: 60 Hz / 250 Hz / 1 kHz / 4 kHz / 12 kHz peaking biquads, ±6 dB per band, applied producer-side at 48 kHz before audio hits the game.

## Install

> 📺 Prefer a video? Watch the [installation guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uwy3pDf4SQ).

1. Download the latest `fh6-universal-radio.zip` from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/forzahorizon6/mods/215).
2. Close FH6.
3. Extract the ZIP into your Forza Horizon 6 install folder (next to `forzahorizon6.exe`). Overwrite when prompted.
4. Launch the game. In **Audio settings**, set **Radio DJ = Off** and **Streamer Mode = On**.
5. Cycle through radio stations until you land on the new one.
6. Open <http://localhost:8420> in any browser on the same machine. From another device on the same network, use your PC's local IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:8420`), run `ipconfig` in a Command Prompt to find it.

### Dependencies

Online radio, YouTube Music, Spotify, Jellyfin, Plex, and non-native local formats rely on external binaries: `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and `librespot`. The mod **downloads them automatically** on first launch into `fh6-radio\bin`, so there's nothing to install by hand.

To manage them yourself instead, set the paths in the dashboard (**Settings > YouTube Music** for yt-dlp, **Settings > General > ffmpeg path**, **Settings > Spotify Connect** for librespot).

### YouTube Music

Private/age-restricted content needs a Netscape `cookies.txt` exported from your browser. Use an extension like **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** to export it.

### Spotify Connect

Enable Spotify under **Settings**, then open the Spotify app on a device on the same Wi-Fi network, tap the **Devices** icon, and pick **FH6 Universal Radio**. Requires an old Spotify Premium account (a Spotify Connect limitation).

### External audio

External Audio is a loopback capture of a Windows playback device, so the app has to play onto a device you don't otherwise hear, or it reaches your speakers directly instead of through the radio. Route it through a virtual audio cable:

1. Install a virtual audio cable, e.g. [VB-Audio Virtual Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
2. Send the app's audio to the cable. Apps without their own output picker (like Deezer) can still be routed from Windows **Settings > System > Sound > Volume mixer**, setting the app's output to `CABLE Input`; for a browser tab, an extension like **AuRo** does the same.
3. In the dashboard, pick that cable as the **Capture device**.
4. Pick the app as the **Media session** for the in-game title/artist and the next/previous controls.

The app then pauses and resumes with the game radio (menus, radio off) instead of playing on in the background.

## Uninstall

- Delete `version.dll` from the game directory.
- Delete the `fh6-radio` folder.
- Verify game files through Steam / Xbox / Microsoft Store to restore the patched assets.

## Build from source

The output is always a Windows `version.dll`. You also need the radio-station media overlay from any existing radio mod ZIP. It's mod-agnostic, but the assets are modified copies of game files so we don't ship them.

### Windows

Requires **Visual Studio 2022+** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload.

```powershell
.\scripts\get-deps.ps1                                                  # one-time: header-only deps
.\scripts\build.ps1                                                     # compile + stage dist\
.\scripts\fetch-media.ps1 -Source "C:\path\to\radio-mod.zip"            # radio-station overlay
.\scripts\install.ps1 -GameDir "C:\XboxGames\Forza Horizon 6\Content"   # copy into game
```

### Linux (cross-compile to Windows)

Requires **CMake** and **llvm-mingw**. On Arch: `sudo pacman -S llvm-mingw cmake`. On other distros, grab a release from [mstorsjo/llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases) and unpack it under `/opt/llvm-mingw` (the build script auto-detects that path).

```bash
./scripts/get-deps.sh                                                   # one-time: header-only deps
./scripts/build.sh                                                      # compile + stage dist/
./scripts/fetch-media.sh /path/to/radio-mod.zip                         # radio-station overlay
./scripts/install.sh ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ForzaHorizon6      # copy into game (Proton prefix)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Dashboard says **bridge offline** | Media overlay not installed. Re-run `install.ps1` with `dist\media\` present. |
| New radio station doesn't show in-game | **Audio > Streamer Mode** is off. Turn it on, restart the game. |
| Local files don't play | The active station has no folders, or its folders only hold unsupported formats. Add a folder in the dashboard's Local Files card. |
| YouTube Music produces no audio | Check `%TEMP%\fh6-stderr.log` (helper-process stderr lands there). Usually expired cookies, or geo/format restrictions. |
| Spotify device doesn't appear or won't play | Wait for `librespot` to finish downloading, confirm your phone/PC is on the same network, and that the account is Spotify Premium. |
| Jellyfin cast returns "fetch failed" (502) | Check server URL, API key, and user ID under **Settings > Jellyfin**, that the playlist ID exists, and that the server is reachable from this machine. Jellyfin transcodes to PCM via `ffmpeg`, so the configured ffmpeg path must be valid. |
| Plex cast returns "fetch failed" (502) | Check server URL and token under **Settings > Plex**, that the playlist ratingKey exists or use **Play Plex Playlist > Scan**, and that the server is reachable from this machine. Plex playback streams through `ffmpeg`, so the configured ffmpeg path must be valid. |
| External Audio plays in the background, not through the radio | You're capturing the same device the app plays on. Route the app's output to a **virtual audio cable** and select that cable as the **Capture device** (see [External audio](#external-audio)). |
| External Audio has clicks / artifacts | Set the virtual cable to **48000 Hz** (2 ch). Other sample rates caused artifacts in testing. |

## Why this exists

[Big John](https://www.nexusmods.com/forzahorizon6/mods/95) released a great **Spotify** radio mod for FH6 that I drew a lot of inspiration from. The catch: it requires Spotify Premium, and the author chose to keep it closed-source. I built FH6 Universal Radio because I believe the project can go much further once the community is allowed to contribute: adding sources (TIDAL, etc.), polishing the UI, fixing edge cases, supporting more game builds. So this one is **fully open and GPLv3-licensed** to make that possible.
